<h2><small>BY ARTHUR DEKKER SAVAGE</small></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Allen Kinderwood</span> slowed
his pace so his forelock would
quit bobbing. The damn thing
wasn't supposed to bob; it was
supposed to be a sort of peaked
crest above rugged, handsome features&mdash;a
dark lock brushed carelessly
aside by a man who had
more important things to do than
fuss with personal grooming. But
no matter how carefully he combed
it and applied lusto-set, it always
bobbed if he walked too fast.</p>

<p>But then, why should it matter
now? He wasn't looking for a
woman tonight. Not when his appointment
with the Social Adjustment
counsellors was tomorrow
morning, and he would get a Departure
Permit. <i>Should</i> get one,
he corrected himself. But he had
never heard of a petition for a
DP being refused.</p>

<p>He wanted to spend his last
night in the city over here in the
main park of C Sector, walking in
the restless crowds, trying to settle
his thoughts. He moved through
slow aimless eddies of brightly appareled
citizens, avoiding other
pedestrians, skaters and the heavy,
four-wheeled autoscooters. Everything
was dully, uncompromisingly
the same as in his own sector,
even to the size and spacing of the
huge, spreading trees. He had
hoped, without conviction, that
there might be some tiny, refreshing
difference&mdash;anything but the
mind-sapping sameness that had
driven him to the petition.</p>

<div class="figc"><img src="images/001.png" width="600" height="505" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p>Allen was careful not to brush
against any girl with an escort.
Since he wasn't on the make, what
would be the use of fighting? Kind
of an odd feeling, though, to know
you'd never date or fight again,
or ... Or what? What else was
there to do, if you hadn't the luck
to be a jobman or a tech? You ate,
and slept, and preened, and exercised,
and found what pleasure
you could, and fought mostly because
it was momentarily stimulating,
and, eventually, after a hundred
and fifty years or so, you died.</p>

<p>Unless you were a tech. If you
were a tech, Government gave you
stuff to keep you alive longer. A
jobman got a somewhat different
deal&mdash;he got nothing to keep him
alive abnormally, because ninety
percent of Earth's population was
waiting for his job anyway.</p>

<p>Allen skirted a huge fountain
throwing colored, scintillant spray
high into the dark summer sky,
stealing a glance backward over his
shoulder. That girl was still behind
him. Following him? It wouldn't
be anything new, in his case&mdash;especially
in his own sector&mdash;but
maybe she just happened to be
going his way.</p>

<p>It would be easy to find out. He
circled the fountain twice. With
her looks she should have been
picked up before she'd left her
compartment building block&mdash;except
that whoever got her might
have to fight more than once during
the evening to hold her. Definitely
a young man's darling.</p>

<p>And, the way it began to look,
definitely Allen's darling. On the
second trip around, she had backtracked
to meet him face to face&mdash;her
purpose obvious.</p>

<p>He tried to dodge, but there was
no way it could be done without
insult. Damn....</p>

<p>"Hi, brute. Nedda Marsh.
Alone?" She ran soft hands along
the hard biceps under his short
jacket sleeves. The motion threw
open her shriekingly bright orange
cloak, displaying saucy breasts,
creamy abdomen and, beneath her
brief jeweled skirt, long smooth
thighs. And the perfume assailed
his nostrils with almost physical
force.</p>

<p>"Hi, Nedda. Allen Kinderwood.
Alone, natch." Natch, hell. But
what could any male do to combat
Government perfume? He smiled,
his pulse suddenly quickening.
"Date, darling?" She <i>was</i> a beautiful
thing.</p>

<p>Her large, sparkling eyes showed
pleasure. "Take me, Al." She
touched vivid red lips lightly
against his. And the formula was
complete. Private citizens Allen
Kinderwood and Nedda Marsh
were dated at least until dawn&mdash;or
a better man did them part.</p>

<p>He squeezed her arm where
she'd snuggled it against his side,
starting with her away from the
fountain. "How come the most
gorgeous thing in Kansas City
wasn't dated earlier?"</p>

<p>She looked up at him, and the
passion in her gaze made his heart
skip like a teener's. "Could be I'm
very particular, darling, but," her
look was suddenly beseeching, "the
truth is, I'm protected."</p>

<p>A slow, tiny fire of distaste
fanned itself alive in Allen's brain.
Why in the name of World Government
did every other girl who
made first play with him have to
be protected? But there was his
out. By unwritten social code
he could declare the date off. Except
that he had grown to increasingly
hate the spiteful practice of
'protection'. It meant Nedda had
peeved some local lothario who,
along with other males in his
clique, was going to damn well see
she wasn't intimate with anyone
else until she begged another date
with the original one. If you had
a sadistic turn of mind, it meant
you could keep a delectable bit in
freeze until her natural inclinations
forced her into your arms. But
you'd have to fight any man who
tried to date her in the meantime.</p>

<p>Fighting was legal, of course, as
long as the loser was surgically repairable,
and it was considered a
normal catharsis for strained relationships
between males.</p>

<p>Not, Allen thought glumly, that
he had any stake in the future of
frantically weary society, but he
had reached the conclusion long
ago that a man without the courage
to back up his personal convictions
wasn't worth the energy it
took to down him.</p>

<p>He stopped and held Nedda
against him protectively. "I still
want the date, sprite," he said. "I
have to leave early tomorrow, but
I'll try to get you out of protection&mdash;okay?"</p>

<p>Her lips trembled. "Oh, yes. If
you knew how it's been, these
last few days&mdash;"</p>

<p>He shook her again, but more
tenderly. "Deal. We'll try to reach
your compartment." Living quarters
were a sanctuary no one but
a medic could legally enter without
invitation. He removed his stainless
identification plaque and
slipped its chain about her throat.
"If you see any of the guys who're
watching for you, tell me but don't
look at them." He took her arm
again and alertly began to work
through the throng. "Describe your
protector."</p>

<p>"Jeff Neal-Hayne. He's big, Al.
Bigger than you. Heavier, but
you've got muscles like he never
saw. You look faster, too."</p>

<p>Allen didn't know him, but the
name was revealing. Not that anything
but your Earth society number
was official, but use of a double
surname meant your father had
elected to stay with your mother
for at least a while after you were
born. Most babies, of course, were
immediately turned over to a Government
creche, but it had always
seemed to Allen that kids raised by
one or more parents had other advantages
too, although he had
never been able to figure out just
what they were. Maybe it was only
his imagination.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">At the</span> edge of the park they
chose the nearest double
scooter which showed full battery
charge.</p>

<p>Allen leaned against the forward
rail. "Herd it, will you, Nedda?
Every time I think of the
hundreds of hours I've spent plowing
air with one of these gut-weighted
things I want to break
one. Hell, I can run faster. Anyway,
you know where we're going."</p>

<p>The girl smiled, pushed the
power lever into forward range and
steered into slow-moving traffic. "I
saw a man lift a single, once, but
that's all he was able to do with
it."</p>

<p>The lighted street seemed intensely
bright after the dimmer
reaches of the park. "Ever think
of running one into the river?"</p>

<p>She looked at him in amazement.
"Fright, no. Why&mdash;you'd
have to drive along a pedestrian
path for at least a block to reach
the bank!" Nedda spun the steering
wheel to avoid a long string of
solemn teeners playing follow the
leader on singles. "You have funny
thoughts, Al."</p>

<p>"I'm laughing." He flexed his
muscles, impatient, as usual, with
another citizen's sluggish mentation.
"I suppose the damn music
never gets on your nerves, either?"</p>

<p>"Music? Oh&mdash;the music." She
listened as though for the first time
to the muted strains which played
continuously throughout the city&mdash;calming,
soothing, lulling. "Of
course not. Why should it?"</p>

<p>"They've got it synchronized,"
said Allen. "Government's got it
synchronized so you hear it just
the same volume no matter where
you are outside. You <i>have</i> to listen
to it."</p>

<p>"Darling, your boredom's showing."</p>

<p>He squeezed her hand reassuringly.
"Don't let me spin you, lovely.
I've got the answer."</p>

<p>"Oh?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. I applied for a DP this
morning."</p>

<p>"Al&mdash;<i>no</i>!"</p>

<p>"Why not?" He put it like the
needle thrust of a fighting knife,
daring her to find a reason, half
hoping she could.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;" She glanced at him once,
quickly, then away. Then she drew
a deep breath and let it sigh out.
"How about Mars, Al? There
aren't many service machines, and
they even let women do lots of little
detailed things. I almost went,
once."</p>

<p>He was watching her shrewdly.
"Why didn't you?" He had fought
this one out with himself before.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I don't know. Just never
did."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you why you really
didn't. It'd be too different. When
the Government provides every
convenience, every comfort you can
think of here, you can't stand having
to work in a mine, with an
oxygen helmet, stuffed into heavy
clothes. You can't stand the danger
and the fear&mdash;and somehow, inside,
you must know it. I'm pretty
strong, and I never met a man I
was afraid of, but I know I
couldn't stand Mars." He gripped
the rail and stared out over the
wide, swarming street. "But Earth
is a trap, Nedda. A big comfortable
trap where you walk around
endlessly without being any use at
all."</p>

<p>She trod the brake and barely
missed bumping a couple who had
stopped to embrace. "<i>I'm</i> some use,
hon. Wait'll we get home." Her
eyes held a promise she could
barely restrain.</p>

<p>Automatically, he caressed her
with a practiced hand&mdash;and
grabbed the wheel when she suddenly
strained against him, trembling,
pressing eager lips against
his neck.</p>

<p>Christ, how long had she been
protected? He felt a mounting
anger against the social ennui which
drove men's minds to such inhuman
activity. Departure was the only
escape from this kind of thing, and
from the city&mdash;from any city.</p>

<p>But the Departees had always
been only a tiny minority. Did that
mean they&mdash;and he&mdash;were wrong?
He brooded about it for seemingly
the googolth time, guiding the
scooter without conscious thought,
turning as Nedda directed.</p>

<p>A trap, he'd told her. Well, he
could see no reason to change that.
The blazingly glorious sensotheaters,
cafes, gymnasiums, dancing
salons, amusement rides and
hypnodream houses, crowding every
main thoroughfare with their fantastically
ornate architecture, were&mdash;when
you thought about it&mdash;designed
to trap people's minds, keep
them from thinking of anything but
a gossamer, useless pursuit of personal
pleasure. And wasn't the design
faulty when everyone was
bored, when some chose Departure
and others sank to the unnatural
practice of protection to whet their
sated appetites?</p>

<p>Nor was there any apparent hope
for the future. Theatre productions,
dream tapes, even the elaborate
home teleview shows were all historical.
Why? Was Government admitting
there was nothing but staleness
in the present? Why the concern
with backtime?</p>

<p>Because of Government entertainment
diet, Allen could probably,
with a bit of practice, fish
skillfully from an outrigger, make
and use a longbow expertly, run a
store profitably in the Money Ages,
weave cloth correctly, build complete
wooden houses&mdash;oh, any number
of ancient things.</p>

<p>But he couldn't even talk the
same language as the relative handful
of trained men who built and
operated the unbelievably intricate
robomachinery which activated and
maintained the complex cities of
Earth.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Nedda's</span> soft voice broke into
his thoughts. "Al&mdash;Dan Halgersen's
coming up behind us on a
single. He's one of Jeff's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold on." Allen swung the
scooter hard right and adroitly
darted across traffic toward an emblazoned
theatre entrance. Here,
now, was a situation he knew how
to deal with. He said rapidly, out
of the side of his mouth, "Jump
off when I stop at the entry and kiss
me like good-by. Register your
plaque in the ID slot and head for
the door&mdash;then look back. If I'm
down, go on in and lose yourself. If
he's down, come back."</p>

<p>He made a wrenching stop at
the very edge of the crowd, swung
Nedda through the opening between
front and side rails and gave
her a hard, sterile kiss.</p>

<p>She clung to him a moment.
Without letting her eyes stray she
said, "Slowing down right behind
you. Luck, lover." Then she turned
and started to pick her way across
the walk.</p>

<p>Allen swung the scooter in a fast,
tight circle to the left. Assuming his
opponent to be right-handed, this
would help avoid a knife slash from
the rear if the other rammed his
scooter&mdash;further assuming the man
had <i>not</i> been tricked into thinking
his presence was unnoticed.</p>

<p>He hadn't. When Allen whipped
his head around to look at him,
there was barely time to brake the
heavier double to avoid a shrewdly
planned collision. Halgersen, Nedda
had said. He was thick-set, with
heavy brows and large jaw. The
type Allen had learned to associate
with power and endurance
but not too much speed.</p>

<p>Halgersen was holding a knife
in his right hand. Allen quickly
slipped his own blade from the
sheath conveniently held at the
front of his belt. They cut intricate
patterns of feint, attack and withdraw,
using passing vehicles as
buffers. But not for long.</p>

<p>A voice from the crowd called,
"Fight!" and space grew miraculously
about the combatants, leaving
a huge clearing in the street
rimmed solidly with scooters and
pedestrians. A few shouts of encouragement
began to be heard as
individuals selected one or the other
of the men as a likely winner.</p>

<p>Allen dodged a sudden attempt
at a side-swipe collision and the
attendant vicious swipe of Halgersen's
blade&mdash;and then drew first
blood by a lightning riposte to the
arm. Legal knife target was arm,
leg, abdomen and a forehead cut
without thrust&mdash;which would obscure
vision with blood without doing
organic damage.</p>

<p>The bright yellow luminescence
of a police copter dropped and
hovered as Allen tried to follow up
his momentary advantage. The
scene, he knew, would now be
simultaneously filmed for possible
legal record and broadcast on all
teleview news programs. Entertainment
for adults, education for
the teeners.</p>

<p>A feminine voice in the front
ranks called, "Two stunts to one
on green jacket!" and was immediately
taken up by another girl near
by.</p>

<p>He had little time to think with
satisfaction that no female had ever
been forced to pay off a bet of some
ingeniously embarrassing public behavior
on his account. Halgersen
was now trying to maneuver him for
a straight ram which would bring
them definitely together. He wasn't
being weakened by the slow drip of
blood from his arm and he didn't
seem to be bothered by pain.</p>

<p>And then they were close to the
circle rim. Allen swung his scooter
so the cooling downdraft from the
copter&mdash;coming from above the
center of the cleared area&mdash;was directly
against his back, a method
he had devised for knowing his position
without having to take his
eyes from a close opponent. He let
his shoulders droop suddenly, as
though he was tired, and at the
murmur of disappointment from
many onlookers he began to back
slowly away from Halgersen.</p>

<p>The blue-jacketed figure rolled
into the trap scowling. He tried
again for a head-on ram. Allen let
him come, and at the last possible
instant, when Halgersen would be
unable to reverse, stop, or even
swerve, he flipped the bar to full
power ahead. And braced himself
accordingly.</p>

<p>The scooters met with a bone-jarring
thud of perimeter rubber.
Halgersen was hurled neatly over
his own guard rail to land gaspingly
across Allen's.</p>

<p>Allen grasped the back of the
other's belt in a grip that had dismayed
many a combatant, hauled
him into position and hamstrung
both legs with two dextrous thrust-and-cut
movements. It took but a
moment longer to leap above a
desperate slash at his own legs,
drag the heavier man to the thick
floor of the scooter and render him
unconscious with a stamping kick
of one sandaled heel. It left an
easy repair job for the medics, but
would keep one Dan Halgersen
from fighting again for more than
a week&mdash;and maybe make him
think twice about joining in another
protection pact.</p>

<p>Allen leaped up and balanced on
two guard rails while the police
copter settled down to pick up
Halgersen. He signaled Nedda to
move on along the walkway.</p>

<p>While the onlookers were clapping
approval of the show, he removed
Halgersen's plaque, leaped
down and dodged an attempted
kiss from the girl who had given
odds on him&mdash;glancing back warily
in case her escort felt insulted&mdash;then
pushed through the mob to
join Nedda.</p>

<p>She hugged his arm ecstatically.
"Darling, every woman should have
a guy like you."</p>

<p>"Yeah." He felt no sense of triumph.
It had happened too many
times before. Everything had happened
too many times before&mdash;repetitive,
palling and purposeless.
He tucked the won plaque into her
decorative belt. It was Nedda's
proof that protection was ended,
and Halgersen would have to call
for it accompanied by a witness.</p>

<p>"Where the hell is your place?"
he asked. For a moment he wondered
why he didn't just turn
abruptly and leave her, social mores
notwithstanding. Then Nedda's
perfume began its chemical magic
again, and he carefully straightened
his jacket and set his forelock in
its proper place.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"Nedda,</span>" he accused lazily,
"you're a nymph. Ever tried
psychoconditioning?"</p>

<p>She gave him a tender, lingering
kiss and burrowed more comfortably
in his arms. "Not yet,
darling. Would you prefer me less&mdash;responsive?"</p>

<p>Allen patted her as carefully as
possible to show approval without
arousing her again. "No man
would. But it must be rough between
dates, isn't it?" And just why
should he be worrying about anyone
else at this stage of the game?
Maybe he wasn't. Maybe he was
just curious now that it no longer
mattered.</p>

<p>She avoided his eyes in the cool
semigloom of the compartment. "I&mdash;usually
manage to have enough
dates. Until some moron like Neal-Hayne
puts me under protection."</p>

<p>He disengaged himself gently,
rolled off the pliant couch and increased
the room's light with the
wall knob. "You should register a
complaint, Nedda. After three he'll
be forcibly psyched, you know." He
dialed the servoconsole and focused
a morning meal menu on the viewscreen.
"Ready for breakfast, pip?"</p>

<p>"Mmm&mdash;if you are." Nedda
came over and lifted the phone
from its panel recess. "That number
six algal protein is supposed
to be a new taste sensation. Like?"</p>

<p>He shrugged. "Let's try it. It'll
be my last go at this robot feed."</p>

<p>When the meals had been deposited
in the service chute she
looked at him pleadingly. "Hon,
why don't <i>you</i> try being psyched?
They could make you satisfied with&mdash;things
as they are."</p>

<p>Allen lifted a thin transparent
food cover while he shook his head.
"Maybe they could, Nedda. But it
would have to be almost total erasure
to change my slant on everything,
and being forced to accept
what I hate is worse than anything
else I can think of. It wouldn't be
me when they got through. Whatever
causes me to think like I do is
the <i>me</i>, and that'd be gone."</p>

<p>Some of the resentful animosity
surged up in him and he had to
talk about it. "Look at your compartment.
The same as every other
single in the city&mdash;or any city. The
walls are the shade of green that's
best for the eyes. Furniture and fixtures
are always the same colors.
Every compartment has a servoconsole
to condition the air, control
the temperature and humidity,
bring you food or any other standard
service, provide teleview
shows, music or requests. You
could live your life inside this
square hole. Everybody has everything
and nothing means anything&mdash;can't
you see that?"</p>

<p>She came around the table and
sat on his lap with her head against
his neck. "No, presh, but if you'll
change your mind about a DP you
can date me any time, always. I'd
like to share a double with you forever."</p>

<p>He traced soothing circles on
her smooth back with his fingertips.
"That's the closest I've ever
come to <i>owning</i> anything," he
mused.</p>

<p>"But, hon, Government owns
everything and takes care of everything.
When you can always use
a thing, how could it be better if
you owned it?"</p>

<p>Allen held her against him tightly,
fighting the old fight to find
words. How could you explain how
you <i>felt</i> things to be right or wrong,
without really knowing the reasons?</p>

<p>"Maybe," he said slowly, "it's as
though I wanted to keep you for
myself alone. But Nedda, if another
man made the right approach,
could you refuse him?"
After a minute he repeated, "Could
you?"</p>

<p>Eventually, she made two answers.</p>

<p>They were warm and wet and
dropped onto his chest.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The Adjustment</span> Building
was a soaring, chastely
white structure of silicoid plastic,
dazzling in the hot morning sun. It
crossed Allen's mind fleetingly that
everything built nowadays would
long outlast the builders. That
seemed right, but he didn't know
why.</p>

<p>He took his ID plaque from
Nedda and kissed her. He had tried
to dissuade her from coming with
him, but she had merely smiled
and held his arm and urged him
toward a double scooter.</p>

<p>"This is it, beautiful," he said
shortly, at the entrance. And, with
an attempt at levity, "Don't take
any more protection." Actually,
what could you say? He went inside
quickly, without looking back.</p>

<p>At the door marked <i>Kansas City
Department of Social Adjustment</i>,
he slipped his plaque into the correct
slot for a moment and was admitted
directly to the waiting room
for those who had appointments
for the day.</p>

<p>There was only one other waiting&mdash;a
handsome blond youth
whose knife was new. Allen sat
down in a lounge chair across the
room.</p>

<p>And Nedda came in and sat
down beside him.</p>

<p>He could have understood almost
anything but that. "How in
the name of fear&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you think," she said mischievously,
taking his hand, "the B
Sector champ is the only one who
can get an appointment?"</p>

<p>Before it could more than flash
through Allen's mind that he'd
not told her that, the blond youth
was standing before them, his eyes
hotly on Nedda. Then, obviously
confused that she was already holding
hands, he addressed himself to
Allen as though it was what he had
intended doing.</p>

<p>"Marty Bowen, sir. Uh&mdash;I'm going
to see if they'll let me have a
double compartment with some
gym apparatus in it." He shifted
his weight to the other foot and
hung a thumb nervously in his belt,
unable to keep from darting glances
at Nedda.</p>

<p>Allen noted, with rising anger
and some other unpleasant emotion
he couldn't define, that she hadn't
dropped her eyes. He said curtly.
"Fine, kid&mdash;hope you make it."
The youth mumbled something else
and went back to his chair.</p>

<p>He had barely seated himself
when a voder speaker crooned a
number melodiously. With a quick
backward glance at Nedda, the
blond lad went on into the counsel
room.</p>

<p>Allen's mind remained in confusion,
shot through with anger at
himself that he should waste
thoughts now on anything but the
coming interview. The room was
beginning to fill quietly with others.</p>

<p>His number was called a few
minutes later.</p>

<p>And Nedda's was called along
with it.</p>

<p>Well&mdash;the place to get the answer
was the counsel chamber. He
got up slowly, barely noticing that
Nedda continued to hold his hand
as they went in.</p>

<p>The brilliant room was two
stories high, with fluted walls and
no windows. Obviously the size was
to impress interviewees. But why
should they have to be impressed?
Wasn't the wisdom of the five tech
doctors sufficient by itself? Wasn't
it?</p>

<p>He sat in a chair indicated by
the dark-skinned one, and listened
while the very old one in the center
talked to Nedda.</p>

<p>Had dating the B Sector park
champion solved her difficulty with
the man she had reported? Fine.
It was the second such report about
him in a year&mdash;the other also coming
from a girl who was highly
sexed. Did Nedda not consider herself
to have a problem which required
psychoconditioning? No?
Well, perhaps in later years, when
her beauty and her mind were
somewhat changed.... No, there
would seem to be no justification
for giving her a compartment in
another sector, unless she had persuaded
the champion or another to
share a double with her. Would
that be all? Much happiness to her.</p>

<p>Abruptly, Allen realized Nedda
had left and that the frail old man
was talking to him.</p>

<p>"... unusual to have joint interviews
without a more definite
emotional tie, but we felt you would
like to know how you had rendered
civic aid."</p>

<p>So pitting him without choice
against any of several men was
their idea of civic aid. No wonder
he'd met so many protected girls in
the past. This time, they'd harnessed
Nedda's restless passion to
the task of dissuading him from a
DP. Very neat.</p>

<p>It made him feel better to know
they'd failed where he was concerned,
and his resentment abated
somewhat. He said, "Glad I could
help," careful to keep his voice
emotionless. Then, determined to
have no further subtleties, "If I
can have my departure permit, I
won't trouble you further."</p>

<p>Maybe his approach wasn't right,
but all they could do would be to
refuse him. In which case there
were other ways&mdash;and the hell with
legality.</p>

<p>"We hope," smiled the old doctor
benignly, "there may be another
way. Perhaps, if we discuss
your problem, we can find a solution
which won't cost the city a
handsome young citizen."</p>

<p>Allen made it a direct attack.
"Why should the city miss any citizen?
In fact, what good is the city
itself&mdash;what good is any city?"</p>

<p>And almost, the techs seemed
startled. But a younger one said
easily, "A city, Mr. Kinderwood,
permits a maximum of efficient
service and pleasure, with a minimum
of waste and discomfort."</p>

<p>Allen leaned back and stubbornly
folded his arms. "I've had
enough of pleasures and comforts
without meaning, and I've nothing
to do, and it doesn't look like anyone's
making any progress anywhere.
Even on the planets they're
just repeating backtime stuff with
modern equipment."</p>

<p>The old man waved a hand at
the others and looked at Allen intently.
His voice was softly insistent.
"The one continuous thread
in human history has been the seeking
of more pleasure and greater
comfort for all members of the
race. Our technology gives us a
maximum of both. No one labors,
and the few who work prefer to do
so. No one is diseased, no one stays
in pain longer than the time necessary
to reach a medic. Everyone can
have everything he needs, without
striving and without debt. And as
technology advances, there will be
even greater benefits for all. What
more can be done to make the citizens
of Earth happy?"</p>

<p>For the first time, Allen felt confused.
"I don't know," he said
slowly. "The way you put it, it
sounds right. But where does it all
lead? What reason have I got for
living? What reason does the human
race have for surviving?"</p>

<p>The sociologist looked even older.
"In all seriousness, sir, can you
answer the questions you have just
asked?" His eyes were expectant&mdash;but
there didn't seem to be much
hope reflected in their depths.</p>

<p>Allen noted a tenseness around
the table. Why were they asking
him for answers they were supposed
to know? Or was it another
of their subtleties?</p>

<p>"No," he said curtly, "I don't
know the answer to any of them.
Has it got a bearing on my getting
a DP?"</p>

<p>The central figure sighed. "None
at all." He pressed several tiny buttons
on the polished table and an
inscribed card rose halfway out of
a slot. "We merely hope that some
day a man will come along who
can tell us&mdash;before someone who
may not be a man comes along and
makes the answers futile." He
handed Allen the card. "Here is
your permit. You may take it to
the third office south on the corridor
through that door. We don't
feel it is the answer to your problem,
but we admit we don't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, sir," interrupted Allen.
He wet his lips. "Did you say
'someone who may <i>not be a man</i>'?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It is an aspect you have
not considered, Mr. Kinderwood."
The sociologist's face seemed haggard.
"Even a few generations ago,
Earth as it is today would have
seemed like a concept of heaven.
We know now it is not enough, but
we don't know why. Perhaps, if we
can reach the stars the problem will
cease to be critical. By the same
token, life from the stars may come
here first.</p>

<p>"We have no remotest idea what
such an eventuality would entail.
It may provide a solution. It may
quite conceivably send man back
to the forests and jungles.</p>

<p>"You have experienced our only
answer to the latter possibility.
While providing man with everything
to which he has aspired for
milleniums, we instill in him,
through the media of entertainment,
knowledge of all the survival
practices known to the backtimers
who painfully nurtured civilization
from an embryonic idea to its present
pinnacle. We can do no more."</p>

<p>Allen flexed his arms involuntarily
at the sheer enormity of the
idea. It was one thing to let a useless
race expire, quite another to
think of its being forced back to&mdash; "But&mdash;can't
anyone think of anything
else to do?"</p>

<p>"Whoever is capable of devising
anything else," the old doctor said
resignedly, "will undoubtedly be
able to carry it out with or without
our assistance." He pressed more
buttons and there was a muted
sound of the voder calling a number.
"The exit over there, Mr. Kinderwood.
And&mdash;much happiness."</p>

<p>Allen's thoughts swirled in tumultuous
confusion. Dimly, he realized
that man had outstripped himself,
and saw with intense bitterness
that there was no answer on Earth
for any ordinary citizen. Or was
there? And if there was, was it
worth trying to find? He flung open
the door to the corridor violently, as
though the force could quiet his
mind. Maybe, if he didn't use the
permit, he could stay and figure
out an answer. Nedda would be
sympathetic and patient while&mdash; And
then he stopped. Across the
wide hallway, Nedda stood beneath
a window, looking at him. And the
blond youth held her with flushed
understanding, impatiently waiting,
caressing her arm with his hand,
binding her to him with the one
bond she could not break.</p>

<p>She watched Allen start slowly
down the corridor. Once, when he
stumbled, she gave a stifled sob, and
tears brimmed and spilled silently
when he passed through the door
marked <i>Kansas City Department of
Euthanasia</i>.</p>
